# Basics
- C# is a programming language , .Net is a Framework for developing applicaitons on windows
- .Net consists of two important components
  a) CLR ( Common language Runtime)
  b) Class Library
- when you compile a c# code , the compiler converts it into an intermediate language code called IL code, CLR is an application which converts the IL code into Machine code & the process is called Just in time compilation
- WPF ( Windows Presentation Foundation ) Application or WinForms Application either of these are used to build Desktop applications for windows
- .Net application consists of Assembly ( DLL dynamically linked libraries or exe) which contains related namespaces which in turn consists of related classes which are like classes in C++ which have data and methods
- C# is a case sensitive language , statements end with a ; C# is a statically typed language
- A namespace allows you to organise your code in order to avoid name collisions
- Console is a class in System namespace which consits of the WriteLine method which is a static method and can be used to print logs to console

  Ex : using System;
        var x = 1;
        var y = 2;
        Console.WriteLine("Hello World!!");
        Console.WriteLine("{0} {1}",x,y);
       var z = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine()); // To read a number from console and convert to int  Convert is a class in System namespace
